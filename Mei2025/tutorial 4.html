A <b><i><big>shepherd</b></i></big> boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields near the forest.<br>He felt this job was very dull and wanted to have some fun.
</p>



<p>
One day while <u>grazing</u> the sheep, he shouted, "Wolf!Wolf!The wolf is carrying<br> away a lamb!" Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for help but<br>didn't find any wolf.
</p>

<p>
The boy laughed and replied,"it was just fun. There is no wolf here"<br>.<b><i><big>The boy played a similar trick repeatedly for many days.</b></i></big>
</p>

<p>
After some days, while the shepherd boy was in the field with the herd of sheep,<br> suddenly, a wolf came out from the nearby forest and attacked one of the lambs.<br>The boy was frightened and cried loudly. "Wolf!Wolf!<strike>The wolf is carrying a lamb away!"</strike>
